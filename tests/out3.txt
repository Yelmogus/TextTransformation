Since this a very large file, we aren't going to write a specific out3.json to compare to. Instead, we will be simply doing a sanity check with the output. Make sure that obvious things like "new york" and "capital district". Can approximately compare with out from https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~goldsd/wordfreq.php?submitted=1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_New_York&ngram=2.
